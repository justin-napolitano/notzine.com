You know we create our own world.  We sit up on the back of turtles... but we can cut down some o the trees.  So what do i hate in this world? 

1. Loud motorclyces
2. air polution
3. Driving
4. Punk ass kids
5. Stress....


I am not seperate from the rest. There is no difference. this is just my take.

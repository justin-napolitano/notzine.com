# notzine

## notzine is nothing

I do not like most websites. I do no like most magazines. I do not like most things. I am afraid of believing in a false narrative... in believing in a narrative of what we are supposed to be... about what one is supposed to do. such things scares me.  I do not want to present a false version of a person to the world.  I want to present something truthful. 

### introduction

So i create notzine. It is not really a magazine. It is not really anything. It is just a place to share honest things. 

### vision

I do not want to lie. I do not want to pretend that i really know the answer to difficult questions. I do not want to give advice. I want to say what i think. I do not want to say that i know.
